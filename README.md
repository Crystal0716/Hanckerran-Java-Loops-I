# Hanckerran-Java-Loops-I  

### Question  

### Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

### Task
Given an integer, N , print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N*i (where 1<= i<= 10 ) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

### Input Format

A single integer, N .

### Constraints  

2<=N<=20

### Output Format

Print 10 lines of output; each line  (where 1<= i <=10 ) contains the result of N*i in the form:
N x i = result.
